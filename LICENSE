"Be Nice" License

Hey so here's the deal, this Stuff (the data, software, media, etc. protected under this license) is free to access and free to use, but be nice about it, alright?
You may use the Stuff as part of your own Thing as long as your Thing is under this or a functionally similar license and the original creator of the Stuff used is credited.
Also don't sell the Stuff or anything that uses it, it was given to you for free, exploiding that is rude.

I don't speak legalese so I hope this covers everything lol
