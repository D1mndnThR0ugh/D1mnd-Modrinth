# D1mnd Modrinth Issue Tracker
Basically the issue tracker for my Modrinth stuff

---
To report or ask something, use the Issues tab

I try to check this pretty often so it doesn't take ages for me to respond to things

---
There are also copies of all packs available on Modrinth so you can download them here too

As stated in the licence you may use my textures in your own packs if you want (with credit ofc)
(as long as you're not making more money than me ):< /silly)

I'm really just here to fix niche things I don't like (:
