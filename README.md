# D1mnd Modrinth Issue Tracker
Basically the issue tracker for my Modrinth stuff

---
To report or ask something, use the Issues tab

Use labels to indicate what project your post is about and what kind of issue you are having

I check this quite often so depending on the problem I should have an answer within a couple of days at most
